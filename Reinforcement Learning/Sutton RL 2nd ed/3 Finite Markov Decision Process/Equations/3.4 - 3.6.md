Equations 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 in the provided text define different ways to derive key quantities from the fundamental dynamics function $p(s',r|s,a)$ of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This main dynamics function, $p(s',r|s,a)$, gives the probability of transitioning to a specific next state $s'$ and receiving a specific reward $r$, given that the agent is in state $s$ and takes action $a$.

Here's an explanation of each equation:

### Equation 3.4: State-Transition Probabilities
$p(s'|s,a) \doteq \text{Pr}\{S_t=s' | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a\} = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} p(s',r|s,a)$

* **Purpose**: This equation calculates the probability of transitioning to a particular next state $s'$, given the current state $s$ and action $a$. It essentially marginalizes out the reward from the main dynamics function.
* **Explanation**:
    * $p(s'|s,a)$: This is the probability of ending up in state $s'$ at the next time step, given that you were in state $s$ and took action $a$ in the previous time step.
    * $\text{Pr}\{S_t=s' | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a\}$: This is the formal probability notation for the same concept. It reads as "the probability that the state at time $t$ is $s'$, given that the state at time $t-1$ was $s$ and the action at time $t-1$ was $a$."
    * $\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} p(s',r|s,a)$: This part shows how to calculate $p(s'|s,a)$. It sums the probabilities of transitioning to state $s'$ and receiving *any possible reward* $r$ (from the set of all possible rewards $\mathcal{R}$), given the current state $s$ and action $a$. In essence, it considers all possible rewards that could accompany the transition to state $s'$ and sums their joint probabilities.

### Equation 3.5: Expected Rewards for State-Action Pairs
$r(s,a) \doteq \mathbb{E}[R_t | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a] = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} r \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s',r|s,a)$

* **Purpose**: This equation calculates the expected (average) reward the agent will receive immediately after taking action $a$ in state $s$.
* **Explanation**:
    * $r(s,a)$: This denotes the expected immediate reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$.
    * $\mathbb{E}[R_t | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a]$: This is the formal expectation notation, meaning "the expected value of the reward $R_t$ received at time $t$, given that the state at time $t-1$ was $s$ and the action at $t-1$ was $a$."
    * $\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} r \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} p(s',r|s,a)$: This part details the calculation. It iterates over all possible rewards $r$ and all possible next states $s'$. For each combination, it multiplies the reward value $r$ by the probability $p(s',r|s,a)$ of transitioning to state $s'$ and receiving that reward $r$ from state $s$ and action $a$. Summing these products gives the overall expected reward.

### Equation 3.6: Expected Rewards for State-Action-Next-State Triples
$r(s,a,s') \doteq \mathbb{E}[R_t | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a, S_t=s'] = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} r \frac{p(s',r|s,a)}{p(s'|s,a)}$

* **Purpose**: This equation calculates the expected reward received when, starting in state $s$ and taking action $a$, the agent transitions to a *specific* next state $s'$.
* **Explanation**:
    * $r(s,a,s')$: This denotes the expected reward given the starting state $s$, the action $a$ taken, and the resulting next state $s'$.
    * $\mathbb{E}[R_t | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a, S_t=s']$: This is the formal expectation, "the expected value of the reward $R_t$, given that the state at $t-1$ was $s$, action at $t-1$ was $a$, AND the state at $t$ (the next state) is $s'$."
    * $\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} r \frac{p(s',r|s,a)}{p(s'|s,a)}$: This shows the calculation.
        * $p(s',r|s,a)$ is the probability of transitioning from $s$ via $a$ to $s'$ *and* getting reward $r$.
        * $p(s'|s,a)$ is the total probability of transitioning from $s$ via $a$ to $s'$ (calculated in Eq. 3.4).
        * The fraction $\frac{p(s',r|s,a)}{p(s'|s,a)}$ is essentially the conditional probability of receiving reward $r$, *given* that a transition from $(s,a)$ to $s'$ has occurred.
        * This conditional probability is then multiplied by the reward value $r$, and these products are summed over all possible rewards $r \in \mathcal{R}$ to get the expected reward for the specific transition $(s, a, s')$.

In summary, these three equations provide ways to derive more specific information (state transition probabilities, expected rewards for state-action pairs, and expected rewards for state-action-next-state triples) from the comprehensive four-argument dynamics function $p(s',r|s,a)$ that defines the environment in an MDP.
