solving an RL task mean finding a policy that achieves a lot of reward over the long run.

A policy $\pi$ is better than or equal to a policy $\pi^{'}$  if the expected return is greater ($v_{\pi}(s)$)

That is always at least one policy that is better than or equal to all other policies, and this is called the optimal policy.

optimal policy is denoted by $\pi_*$.
