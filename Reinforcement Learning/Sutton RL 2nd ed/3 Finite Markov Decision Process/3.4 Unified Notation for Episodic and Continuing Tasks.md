episodic is mathemtaically easier than continuing tasks because each action affects only the finite numbre of rewards subsequently received during the episode.

new math notation for episodic: we need to consider a series of episode, each contains a finite sequence of time steps.

So, instead of $S_{t}$, we need to use $S_{t,i}$ that represent time $t$ at episode $i$. HOWEVER, in discussing episodic tasks, we always treat them all the same (no difference between each episode), or stating something that is true for all episodes.SO, we still use $S_t$ ( what was that even about) to refer to $S_{t,i}$.

some other info about notations, not very important, but may need frequent revisit to understand (I already starting to not like this book).
