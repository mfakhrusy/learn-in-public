RL relies to the concept of state:
1. as input to the policy and value function
2. as both input and output from the model

state: a signal conveying to the agent some sense of "how the environment is" at a particular time.

formal definition of a state above is given by framework of [[Markov Decision Process (summary)]].

informal: state as whatever information is available to the agent about its environment.

Not focus on state signal itself (including constructing, changing, or learning of it) because the focus should be the decision-making part.

So, the focus is not designing the state signal, but what action to take as a function of whatever state signal is available.

focus: estimating value functions (not focus on evolutionary algorithm, although it can solve RL problems)

why ? Focus on RL methods that learn while interacting with the environment. evolutionary algorithm doesn't do that.

evolutionary method is not well suited to solve RL problems, so not included in the book
