1. Policy
2. Reward Signal
3. Value function
4. (optional) Model of the environment

Policy: 

- agent way of behaving at given time
- mapping from perceived states of the env -> actions to be taken
- in psychology, stimulus-response rules or associations
- may be a simple function or a lookup table, or can involve extensive computation (such as search process)
- may be stochastic, specifying probabilities of each action

reward signal:

- defines the goal of RL problem
-
