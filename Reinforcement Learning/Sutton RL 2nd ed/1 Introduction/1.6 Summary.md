RL: computational approach to understand and automate goal-directed learning and decision making. Emphasize on learning by agent from direct interaction with the environment, without requiring supervision or complete model of the environment.

RL use formal framework of [[Markov Decision Process (summary)]] to define interactions between a learning agent and its env in terms of state, action, and reward.

value function are important for efficient search in the space of policies. the use of value function distinguish RL from evolutionary algorithms.
