## Stationary Preferences in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

In the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), **stationary preferences** refer to the assumption that an agent's preferences over sequences of rewards do not change over time. This means that if an agent prefers one sequence of future rewards over another from a particular state, it will maintain that preference regardless of when that state is encountered or what rewards preceded it.

This concept is a fundamental assumption in many MDP formulations, particularly those with infinite horizons. It essentially implies that the desirability of a future trajectory of rewards is judged consistently, irrespective of the current time step.

**Relationship with Stationary Policies:**

Stationary preferences are closely linked to the idea of **stationary policies**. A stationary policy is a decision-making rule where the action chosen by the agent depends only on the current state, not on the time step or the history of previous states and actions.

The assumption of stationary preferences provides a strong justification for seeking optimal policies that are themselves stationary. If an agent's underlying preferences don't change with time, then the optimal way to behave in a given state should also remain consistent over time. Indeed, for many common MDP settings, particularly infinite-horizon discounted reward problems with finite states and actions, it can be proven that an optimal stationary policy exists.

**Implications and Significance:**

1. **Simplification of Problem Solving:** Assuming stationary preferences (and thus often searching for stationary policies) significantly simplifies the problem of finding an optimal policy. Instead of needing to determine the best action for every possible state-time pair (which would be a non-stationary policy), the agent only needs to find the best action for each state.
    
2. **Time-Independent Optimal Actions:** Under stationary preferences, the optimal action to take in a particular state will be the same regardless of how many time steps have passed or what sequence of events led to that state.
    
3. **Foundation for Algorithms:** Many standard MDP solution algorithms, like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, are designed to find optimal stationary policies. These algorithms rely on the underlying assumption that preferences (and thus optimal actions) are stable over time.
    

**Contrast with Non-Stationary Preferences/Policies:**

In contrast, if preferences were non-stationary, the optimal action in a given state might change depending on the time remaining (e.g., in a finite-horizon problem) or other time-dependent factors. This would necessitate finding a non-stationary policy, where the action selection rule could vary at different time steps even for the same state. For instance, if an agent has a limited time to achieve a goal, its actions near the deadline (end of the horizon) might be drastically different from its actions at the beginning, even if it finds itself in the same state.

**In summary:** Stationary preferences in an MDP mean that the agent's underlying valuation of future reward sequences is consistent over time. This assumption simplifies the search for optimal behavior and often leads to the existence and pursuit of optimal stationary policies, where the best action for a given state does not change with time.

Q: is it like wherever you start in the state, you will end up doing the same action? (I guess I should have worded this question better, because the answer is what I implied!)

Gemini answered

Not exactly, but it's very close to one aspect of it. Let's clarify:

A **stationary policy** means that if you are in a **particular state**, say State 'A', you will always choose the **same action** (e.g., Action 'X') every time you find yourself in State 'A', regardless of:

- **When** you arrive in State 'A' (e.g., at time step 5 or time step 50).
- **How** you arrived in State 'A' (the sequence of previous states and actions).

However, it **does not** mean that you will do the same action in _every single state_. The policy is a mapping from states to actions.

- So, in **State 'A'**, a stationary policy might always dictate Action 'X'.
- But in **State 'B'**, the same stationary policy might always dictate Action 'Y'.
- And in **State 'C'**, it might always dictate Action 'Z'.

**Think of it like a fixed rulebook:**

- The rule for "when in State A" is always "do Action X."
- The rule for "when in State B" is always "do Action Y."

The "wherever you start in the state" part of your question is key.

- If you mean "whenever you land in _a specific state_ (like State A)," then yes, a stationary policy means you'll always take the same pre-defined action _for that specific state_.
- If you mean "wherever you start the _entire process_ (e.g., your initial state for the whole problem)," the sequence of actions you take will unfold based on the states you transition through, but the action taken _at each specific state encountered_ will be consistent according to the stationary policy.

So, the action depends on the state, but for any given state, the chosen action is fixed and doesn't change over time or based on history if the policy is stationary.
