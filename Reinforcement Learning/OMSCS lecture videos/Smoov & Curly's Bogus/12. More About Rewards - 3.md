answer:

first, the +2

grid (3,3): L -> expected reward is 2x0.8 + 2x0.1 + 2x0.1 = 2
grid (3,2): L -> expected reward is 2
grid (3,1): U (or R, or L, or D): because no difference, all expected reward is 2
grid (4,1): D -> expected reward is 2

now, the -2

grid (3,3): R -> expected reward is 1x0.8 + -2x0.1 + -2x0.1 = 0.4
grid (3,2): R -> go directly to red is better because it has better reward (-1 is greater than -2)
grid (3,1): R (i dont know why, U should also works), explained below
grid (4,1): U -> also go directly to red

answer video:

the +2 means we shouldn't go to red or green, we can just go to the normal state.

The + means it doesn't matter where to go


--------------

the -2 answer

so, the  (3,1) grid have an answer R because it has less chance to slip. if going R, you can only end up to R itself, or to U. But if we intend to go U, we can go to U, R, and L. and L is bad since it's so far away.

--------


On R(s) = -2. these are the different response than R(s) = -.04, because we just want to end the game, even if it's the RED state.
