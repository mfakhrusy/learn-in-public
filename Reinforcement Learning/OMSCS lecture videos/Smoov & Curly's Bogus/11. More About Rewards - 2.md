example: reward on every state (except green and red) is -0.04

what does having negative state like this encourage us to do? maybe something like walking in a hot beach.

by having negative state everywhere, it encourages us to end the game (no stalling).

example policy is above

but, there's something strange. the (3,1) grid is going to the left, why? it looks like it should be going up.

The reason is, because the movement is stochastic (0.8 straight, 0.1 tilted right, 0.1 tilted right), going up from (3,1) to (3,2) will make it more likely to go to the red state, so, the optimum policy would go to the left.

if we have a slightly different reward, maybe the policy will change too.
