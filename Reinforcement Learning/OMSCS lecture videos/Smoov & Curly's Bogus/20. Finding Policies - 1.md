the above is N equations, and N unknown (the missings are the U only)

max -> makes it non-linear

- start with arbitrary utilities
- update based on neighbors
- repeat above until convergence

## $U(s)$: Utility of a State

**$U(s)$ represents the utility of being in a particular state '$s$'**.

More specifically:

1.  **Measure of "Goodness" or "Desirability":**
    * $U(s)$ quantifies how good it is for an agent to be in state `s`.
    * A higher $U(s)$ indicates that the state is more valuable or desirable from the agent's long-term perspective.

2.  **Represents Expected Long-Term Reward:**
    * $U(s)$ is not just about the immediate reward received in state `s`.
    * It signifies the **expected total discounted future reward** an agent can achieve if it starts in state `s` and acts optimally from that point onwards.
        * **Expected:** It's an average over possible future outcomes, as the environment's transitions or rewards might be stochastic.
        * **Discounted:** Future rewards are typically valued less than immediate rewards. This is captured by the discount factor $\gamma$ (gamma) in the Bellman equation.
        * **Future Reward:** It encompasses all rewards from the current state `s` until the end of an episode or task.
        * **Optimal Action:** The $U(s)$ derived from the Bellman optimality equation (as shown in your image) specifically refers to the utility achieved if the agent follows the *optimal policy* (i.e., always makes the best possible decisions) from state `s` onwards.

3.  **Defined by the Bellman Equation:**
    * The equation:
        `U(s) = R(s) + γ * maxₐ Σ_{s'} T(s, a, s') * U(s')`
        is the Bellman optimality equation for state utilities.
    * This equation demonstrates that the utility of a state `s` is the sum of:
        * The immediate reward `R(s)` obtained in (or for transitioning from) state `s`.
        * The discounted maximum expected utility of the next possible states (`s'`), which is achieved by choosing the optimal action `a` in state `s`.

**In essence, $U(s)$ (often denoted as $V^*(s)$ for the *optimal* state value in many texts) is the best possible sum of future discounted rewards the agent can expect to accumulate if it begins in state `s` and consistently makes optimal choices thereafter. Computing these utility values is fundamental for an agent to learn how to make decisions that maximize its overall reward over time.**

so, let's update the utility of the next time step by calculating it from the old utility estimate (the U hat t)
